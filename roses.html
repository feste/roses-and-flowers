  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <p>In this experiment, we would like you to judge the acceptability of some sentences. We would like you to base your judgement on how natural the sentence is, both in the <b>content</b> and in the <b>phrasing</b>.</p>
  <p>We will give you some practice questions first, so you can get an idea of how we would like you to use this scale.</p>
  <p>Please click "Begin" when you're ready to start.</p>
